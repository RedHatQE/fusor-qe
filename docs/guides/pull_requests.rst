Pull Requests
=============

Guidelines
----------

Submitting
^^^^^^^^^^

* If your code will require the documentation to be updated, include those documentation updates in your PR.
* Once submitted, request review from the team (via IRC or email).
* If a reviewer responds with comments/questions, please address them promptly to ensure your PR is merged in quickly.

Reviewing
^^^^^^^^^

All pull requests made against the fusor-qe repo will need to be reviewed by 2 people before they can be
merged. The process is simple:

1. A developer submits a new Pull Request and asks the team to review.
2. Once a team member reviews the code and decides it is acceptable, they comment on the PR with a thumbs up
   (using the text ":+1:").
3. Once two reviewers have commented with a thumbs up, the PR can be merged by the
   developer who submitted it. [*]_


.. [*] This is so they can make the final decision on its readiness for merging.
