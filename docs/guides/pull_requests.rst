Pull Requests
=============

Guidelines
----------

Submitting
^^^^^^^^^^

* If your code will require the documentation to be updated, include those documentation updates in your PR.
* Once submitted, request review from the team (via IRC or email).
* If a reviewer responds with comments/questions, please address them promptly to ensure your PR is merged in quickly.

Reviewing
^^^^^^^^^

All pull requests made against the fusor-qe repo will need to be reviewed by 2 people before they can be
merged. Currently, the way we handle this workflow is with the Github integration lgtm.co. The process is
simple:

1. A developer submits a new Pull Request and asks the team to review.
2. Once a team member reviews the code and decides it is acceptable, they comment on the PR with the
   acronym "lgtm" (short for "Looks good to me").
3. Once two reviewers have commented with "lgtm", the merge button will unlock, and the PR should be merged by
   the developer who submitted it. [*]_


.. [*] This is so they can make the final decision on its readiness for merging.
